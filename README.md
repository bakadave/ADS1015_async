# ADS1015_async
Asynchronous Arduino library for the Adafruit ADS1015 board. This library was written by TonDuino and was posted to http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=490982.new#new

I uploaded it to make it easier for people to download it on headless systems and because I couldn't be bothered to figure out how to download zips from the Arduino Forum on a RPi. I will gladly delete this if it's a problem.

Master branch contains the original source code.
